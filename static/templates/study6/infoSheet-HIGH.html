        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            A more detailed description of this research follows.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            <strong><u>Introduction</u></strong><br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            You are invited to participate in a research study to investigate how users interact with the computer in a simulated target
            detection task. You will play an online game in which your task is to identify dangerous vehicles in several images. In the game,
            you will be paired with either another Mechanical Turk worker or an automated target detection system to work together as a team
            to identify dangerous vehicles.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            <strong><u>Why is this study being done?</u></strong><br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            The purpose of this study is to better understand how different features of an online target detection systems affect users'
            attitude toward the system. Specifically, your participation will help us find the answer to the following research question:
            How do an automated system's attributes influence operators' interaction with the system? By investigating the factors that
            affect operators' interaction with the game, we hope to learn how to improve automated system design and promote safer and
            effective use of such systems.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            <strong><u>What are the study procedures? What will I be asked to do?</u></strong><br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            The study includes playing a web-based game and a survey. You will be asked to play five rounds of a 2-minutes long online
            target detection game. You will also answer survey questions after the gameplay.
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            <strong>During gameplay, you will work as a team with either another Mechanical Turk worker or an automated target detection system to classify a group of images as "Dangerous" or "Not Dangerous." In each round, you will choose how many images to allocate to yourself and your partner. Once all gameplay rounds are complete, you will be forwarded to a survey hosted on Qualtrics.</strong>
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            <strong>During the game, if you are paired with another Mechanical Turk worker, we will ask for your camera/webcam permission. If you allow the camera permission, we will live stream the video of your face to the other worker. Note that allowing camera permission is optional and you can still participate even if you decide not to share your video with your partner.  Similarly, you will watch the other workerâ€™s video on your screen if s/he allows camera permission. However, we will not record or store the video of you or the other worker in our server. Note that you will not be able to chat/talk/communicate with the other player during the gameplay. Similarly, you will not hear any audio from your partner's side.</strong>
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            <strong>If you are paired with the automated system, you will not be asked to turn on your camera.</strong>
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            After the game play, in the survey, you will be asked questions about your gameplay experience, your personality traits, and some basic demographic information. You will also respond to some open-ended questions related to the game. We will include a few multiple-choice attention check questions throughout the survey asking for a specific response to ensure mindful responses. You have to correctly answer those questions to receive the compensation for participating in the study.
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            Once the survey is complete, you will be given a 10-digit code to submit into Mechanical Turk.  This random 10-digit code will be used to connect you with the completed survey and gameplay for compensation.
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            <strong>Participation will involve approximately 30 minutes of your time. Since you may play the game with another Mechanical Turk worker, you have to complete the study in one sitting.</strong>
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            <strong>The game is only supported on the Google Chrome web browser. You have to use the Google Chrome browser to continue to the game page.</strong>
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            Some research requires that the full purpose of the study not be explained before you participate. We will give you a full explanation when we are no longer enrolling participants.
            <br>

        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            <strong><u>What are the risks or inconveniences of the study?</u></strong><br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            We believe that there are no risks associated with this research study. A possible inconvenience may be the time it takes to complete the study. Moreover, the game involves time pressure which can potentially be stressful.
            <br>
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            <strong><u>What are the benefits of the study?</u></strong><br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            You may not directly benefit from this research. However, insights gained from this study may help researchers to design better automated systems in the future.
            <br>
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            <strong><u>Will I receive payment for participation? Are there costs to participate?</u></strong><br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            <strong>There are no costs for you to participate. You can earn $5.00 by scoring top 50% scores in your game condition. However, if you cannot be in the top 50% scoring teams, you will receive $2.00 for completing all gameplay rounds and the post-game survey.</strong>
            <br>

            &nbsp;<br>
            You will receive $1.99 compensation after you submit the 10-digit code into Mechanical Turk. You will receive the remaining $0.01 with a debriefing statement explaining the full purpose of the study when we are no longer enrolling participants. If you are one of the top 50% scoring teams, you will receive the $3.00 at this point.
